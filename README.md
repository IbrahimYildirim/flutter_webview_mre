# testing_webview

A **Minimum Reproducable Example** project of `webview_flutter 3.0.4` package with the error:

```
[ViewportSizing] maximumViewportInset cannot be larger than frame
[ViewportSizing] minimumViewportInset cannot be larger than frame
```

**Webview shows up in dev config (giving the error), but shows a blank gray screen on release configuration.**
